mkinit is a tiny init daemon that relies on mk for determining the order init
services need to be executed. 


Init scripts
------------
Init scripts take the form of mk rules contained in /etc/init.mk. Services are
started by calling  the `start-<service>' rule and stopped by calling
`stop-service'. Services should use `:Pservice -[ud]:' to determine whether the
script needs to be invoked.

For simple services consisting of a single start and stop command which no
dependencies other than boot, the default start-stop rules can be used by
setting `<service>_start_cmd' and `<service>_stop_cmd'.

Dependencies are handled by adding `start-<dependency>' to the rules list of
dependencies. When stopping a service, `stop-<service>' should be added to the
list of dependencies for the dependency.
